# Skills-Lab-5
This program was made by Justin Booth and Michael Harouse:

This program is supposed to take a name in and an age and tell them what age group they are in. The user enters the name and the age and it outputs their age group for them to see.This program is for complete satire purposes.

Installaition: You have to down load the file and open it in a code editing software like Jupyter hub. Then run the file.

How to Use: You have to enter your name or anyones name you wish, then enter their age. Once this is done the program executes the code and outputs their age group.

How to contribute your hard work: You can attempt to edit and make any files you wish to this project. After you submit the request it will be looked over by our execitive order and be judged on if it is worthy enough to be added to the project. All who contribute are thanked for their willing or unwilling envolvment with this fantastic project.
